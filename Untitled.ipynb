    "#### Что такое буллинг\n",
    "\n",
    "Буллинг – проявление психологического насилия, направленное на то, чтобы сознательно доставить человеку дискомфорт и страдания, вызвать у него страх и подчинить с его помощью себе. Такое насилие носит длительный и систематический характер, и в случае детей от 7 до 18 лет, осуществляется в адрес личностей, по причине возраста и незрелости неспособных защитить себя.\n",
    "\n",
    "Кибербуллинг может отличаться от обычного буллинга анонимностью. Как показывают исследования, “кибер-жертвы” в большинстве случаев не знают, кто агрессор (Kowalski, Limber, 2007)."

    "#### Каковы последствия кибербуллинга в 21-м веке?\n",
    "\n",
    "Последствия кибербулинга очень разнятся и степень их серьезности значительно отличается. Кибербуллинг может привести к:\n",
    "\n",
    "- росту уровня тревоги\n",
    "- стрессу\n",
    "- нарушению сна\n",
    "- психосоматическим расстройствам\n",
    "- снижению академической успеваемости и прогулам\n",
    "- снижению самооценки\n",
    "- депрессии.\n",
    "Недоброжелатели у каждого человека есть и в обычной жизни, но когда вашу жизнь могут наблюдать 5-10 человек, и когда вы каждый день находитесь под наблюдением и влиянием от 10 до 1000 (в соцсетях) и более 10 000 людей (в блогах, в зависимости от количества подписчиков), давление сильно растет. Не каждый может выдержать информационный негативный поток в свой адрес. Блогеры последних лет практически все прошли через настоящую интернет-травлю."

    "- Не выкладывать личные данные: адреса, фотографии, телефоны, почты и тем более - пароли от почт или личных кабинетов.\n",
    "- Не общаться с незнакомцами. По данным ежегодного опроса «Лаборатории Касперского», 70% детей принимают заявки в “друзья” от незнакомых людей, более 30% встречались с ними в онлайне. \n",
    "- Не высказываться негативно о других в виртуальной среде.\n",
    "- Игнорировать агрессию и угрозы. \n",
    "- Читать просветительские статьи, а также использовать специальные приложения для защиты. Для безопасности детей обязательно купить приложение, которое позволяет понять, какие сайты просматривает ребенок, настроить доступ к безопасным сайтам и ограничить времяпровождение в соцсетях и сайтах с агрессивной средой."
